    <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
    <p>
        Over the next two years, I have set specific, measurable, and time-bound goals to advance my career in the tech field. My goals are divided into four main categories: Skill Development, Projects and Experience, Networking and Community Involvement, and Career Advancement.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Skill Development</h3>
    <p>
        1. Learn Advanced JavaScript: By December 2024, I aim to master advanced JavaScript concepts, including ES6+, asynchronous programming, and modern frameworks such as React or Vue.js. To achieve this, I will enroll in an advanced JavaScript course and complete various projects to solidify my understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Get Certified in Cloud Computing: I plan to obtain an AWS or Azure certification by June 2025. This will involve dedicated study time each week, completing online courses, and passing the certification exam. This certification will enhance my cloud computing skills and make me more competitive in the job market.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Projects and Experience</h3>
    <p>
        1. Build a Full-Stack Application: By March 2025, I will develop and deploy a full-stack application using Node.js and React. This project will involve designing the application, coding both the frontend and backend, and deploying it on a cloud platform. The project will serve as a showcase of my full-stack development capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Contribute to Open Source: By the end of 2024, I aim to contribute to at least three open-source projects on GitHub. I will find projects that align with my interests and skill level, contribute code, and participate in community discussions. This will help me improve my coding skills and gain valuable experience working on real-world projects.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Networking and Community Involvement</h3>
    <p>
        1. Attend Tech Conferences: I plan to attend at least two major tech conferences or meetups each year. These events will provide opportunities to network with industry professionals, learn about the latest trends, and gain insights from experts in the field. I will actively participate in sessions and workshops to maximize my learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Join a Tech Community: I will become an active member of a tech community, such as a local coding group or an online forum. I will participate in discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. This involvement will help me build connections and stay updated with the latest developments in the tech industry.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Career Advancement</h3>
    <p>
        1. Apply for Internships/Jobs: Starting January 2025, I will begin applying for internships or junior developer positions. I will tailor my resume and portfolio to highlight my relevant skills and projects. I will also practice interview techniques and seek feedback to improve my chances of securing a position.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Develop Soft Skills: I will focus on improving my communication and teamwork skills by participating in group projects and taking relevant workshops. Effective communication and collaboration are essential for success in the tech industry, and I aim to strengthen these skills over the next two years.
